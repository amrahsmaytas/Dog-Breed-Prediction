For our inaugural competition, we're working with Save All The Pets, a philanthropic organization in the US with the endgame of moving shelter animals to shelters where they'll be more likely to be adopted.

We know that certain dog breeds are more likely to be adopted versus killed in different animal shelters, and those dogs can be moved to other shelters. However, not all shelter dog breeds are known, so they can't as easily be saved.

The goal of this challenge is to predict a dog's breed given an image of it - you can also use optional features like color, sex, age, and size. You will be given a clean CSV of around 83,000 dog images with breed labels, and some other columns.

Let's save some dogs!
